# Ordered Field (Axler, S)
An *ordered field* is a field $\mathbb{F}$ with a subset $\mathbb{P}$ of $\mathbb{F}$, called the *positive* subset, with the following properties:

+ If $a \in \mathbb{F}$ or $a = 0$ or $-a \in \mathbb{P}$

+ If $a \in \mathbb{P}$, then $-a \notin \mathbb{P}$.

+ If $a,b \in \mathbb{P}$, then $a+b \in \mathbb{P}$ and $ab \in \mathbb{P}$

**The positive subset is closed under multiplicative inverse**: Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is an ordered field with positive subset $\mathbb{P}$. Then

+ $1 \in \mathbb{P}$

+ $a^{-1} \in \mathbb{P}$  $\forall a \in \mathbb{P}$

***Proof** (Axler, S) 
To prove (a), note that the definition of an ordered field implie that either $1 \in \mathbb{P}$ or $-1 \in \mathbb{P}$. <br />
If $1 \in \mathbb{P}$, then we are done. <br />
If $-1 \in \mathbb{P}$, then $1 = (-1)(-1) \in \mathbb{P}$ (because $\mathbb{P}$ is closed under multiplication). Either way, the proof is completed.<br />

To prove (b), suppose $a \in \mathbb{P}$. If we had $-a^{-1} \in \mathbb{P}$, then we would have $-1 = (-a^{-1})a \in \mathbb{P}$ (because $\mathbb{P}$ is closed under multiplication), which contradicts the second bullet point of **4**. Thus $a^{-1} \in \mathbb{P} \forall a \in \mathbb{P}$, as desired.

# Less than; greater than

Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is an ordered field with positive subset $\mathbb{P}$. Suppose $a,b \in \mathbb{F}$. Then:

+ $a < b$ is defined to mean $ b - a \in \mathbb{P}$

+ $a \le b$ is defined to mean $a < b$ or  $a = b$;

+ $a > b$ is defined to mean $b > a$;

+ $a \ge b$ is defined to mean $a>b$ or $a = b$
